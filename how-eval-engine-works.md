# How Eval Engine works?

The evaluation process follows these steps:

1. Client signs an evaluation request transaction
2. Engine receives and double-signs the transaction
3. Engine submits the signed transaction to Chromia blockchain
4. Engine processes the evaluation
5. Engine stores results on the blockchain
6. Client receives the evaluation results

> All transactions and results are permanently stored on Chromia blockchain, ensuring transparency and auditability. Clients interact with the system through a simple SDK/API interface, while the Engine handles all blockchain operations.

    participant C as Client
    participant E as Engine
    participant B as Chromia Blockchain

    C->>C: Sign evaluate_tweet_request tx
    C->>E: Submit signed tx hash
    activate E
    E->>E: Double sign tx
    E->>B: Submit double-signed tx
    E->>E: Run evaluation process
    E->>B: Submit update_tweet_scores
    E-->>C: Return evaluation result
    deactivate E

    note over B: All transactions stored<br/>transparently on chain
    note over C,E: Client only interacts with<br/>Engine API directly
```
